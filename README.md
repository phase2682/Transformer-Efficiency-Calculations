# Transformer-Efficiency-Calculations

Excel workbook - xfrmr loss calcs v1_1.xlsx - has example data for a toroid with and without a 100 pF primary capacitor.  Also calibration data for load resistor.  
Complex number calculations included.  
Download the file, load your own data (S2P -> F S11 S22 R I) into the spreadsheet to calculate transformer loss/efficiency.  
v1_1 eliminates irrelevant link to external data
